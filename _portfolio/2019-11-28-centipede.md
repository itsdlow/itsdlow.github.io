## The Experience

This project was the result of 24+ hours per week of work in a 10 week object-oritented game design course at DePaul University. As it was for a class, we simulated a game development environment following a sprint schedule. In addition, we were to implement design strategies at every opportuntity, and be considerate of enabling seemless playtesting, facilitating changes to be easily made in the game.

This was a pivotal project for my development as a software engineer, I can still hardly believe the size of this project, containing 376 files and 8999 lines of code. 

## Design Patterns

We used numerous design patterns throughout the development of this game including: singleton, strategy, command, finite state machine, flyweight, and factory. 

### Singleton
- The singleton design pattern was used in all aspects of the design as managers for sound, 

### Strategy
- Stuff

### FSM
- Stuff

### Factory
- Stuff
