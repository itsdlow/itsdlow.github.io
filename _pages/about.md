I recently graduated DePaul University with a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Computer Science and am currently pursuing a Master of Science (MS) degree in Software Engineering - Real-Time Game Systems. I believe I will forever be a student, but wish to allow myself time to further develop myself to a truly proficient software engineer and architect through the experience of my Master's degree. I enjoy programming and am very interested in the sciences, but I even more so love to solve challenging issues, which STEM has no lack of. 

In addition to being student, I also tutor and am actively involved in computational biology research at DePaul University. I have found learning to teach to be one of the most helpful challenges I have been faced with, as it challenges both my personality and knowledge as a developer. I have also found myself very passionate in the work I am doing as a member of DePaul's Computational Biology and Applied Bioinformatics (CoBaAB) Lab, as intersection between computer science and biology has always facinated me and motivated to minor in Biology, as well as considering further my education in the subject.

Outside of my software dev and school life, I enjoy video games and staying active. I am currently practicing Muay Thai as well as attempting to become a triathlete in the upcoming 2021 Chicago Triathlon.

This website is a simple data-driven Jekyll-based blog, hosted by Github Pages, and uses a template from [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).

This site is meant to act as my portfolio and as such houses some projects that I have developed or contributed to. The layout is very basic, the ["Portfolio"](https://itsdlow.github.io/portfolio/) page houses all of my project contributions posts which provide detailed descriptions. The ["Talks"](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/) and ["Publications"](https://itsdlow.github.io/publications/) page holds formal results from some of the research I have been apart of.
