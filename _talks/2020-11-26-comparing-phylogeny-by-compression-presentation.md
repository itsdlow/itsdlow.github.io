This presentation explores the standard techniques used for phylogenetic inference in comparison to the Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) technique which we introduce. We discuss results generated by each of these methods as well as the advantages that NCD, a distance-based alignment-free method, has over the standard techniques, including: fast execution times for phylogeny construction and minimal restrictions on input data.
